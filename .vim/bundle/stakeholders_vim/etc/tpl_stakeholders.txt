*stakeholders.txt*  Charismatic, overachieving, dynamically expansive place-holders
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Older templating plugins for VIM often used simple markup for 
placeholders (e.g. <+VARIABLE_NAME+>). A placeholder was simply a 
pattern you could easily search for. Some newer templating plugins (e.g. 
xptemplate vimscript #2611) support dynamic replacement of placeholders 
with the same name.

The stakeholders plugin turns your old templating system into a high 
potential overachiever. It provides dynamic replacement of placeholders 
for older templating plugins. By default, it assumes placeholders match 
/<+\([[:alpha:]_]\+\)+>/ since this pattern is used in several 
templating systems. You can easily change that pattern by setting 
|g:stakeholders#def| or b:stakeholders_def.


Usage~

The tskeleton templating plugin provides a parameter 
(|g:tskeleton#enable_stakeholders|) that enables integration with the 
stakeholders plugin. For other templating plugins, you have to enable 
stakeholders by calling either |stakeholders#EnableBuffer()| or 
|stakeholders#EnableInRange()|.

Known issues~

    - Replacing a visual selection by pasting text (using paste#Paste()) 
      doesn't work. You have to delete the selection first and paste the 
      text afterwards.
