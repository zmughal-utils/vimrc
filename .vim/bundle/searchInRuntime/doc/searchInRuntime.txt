                                                *SiR-presentation*
                                                *search-in-directories-list* 
Presentation~

The plugin *searchInRuntime.vim* defines commands that:
1- search for files whose name match specified {file-patterns} within list of
   directories ({var}, $PATH or 'runtimepath').
2- execute the Ex command {cmd} on the files found, if any.

If you are a worshiper of: >
    $> find {path} -name {pattern} -exec {command}
then, you may be interested by these three VIM commands:
    :SearchInVar[!] {var} {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]
    :SearchInPATH[!]      {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]
    :SearchInRuntime[!]   {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]

It also defines wrappers for |:sp| and |:vsp|: |:Sp| and |:Vsp| that split open
a file searched into 'path', and a wrapper for |:runtime|: |:Runtime|.


All these commands support automatic completion. |SiR-completion|.

                                                *SiR-parameters*
Parameters~
When [!] is included, all found files are passed to the Ex command {cmd}.
When it is not included only the first file found is passed to {cmd}.


When {file-patterns} contains wildcards, it is expanded to all matching files.
Example: >
        :SearchInRuntime! Echo plugin/*.vim
Will echo the name of all VIM plugins.
This similar command: >
        :SearchInRuntime Echo plugin/*.vim
would echo the name of the first file only.

Contrary to |:runtime|, the search accepts absolute paths ; for instance: >
    :runtime! /usr/local/share/vim/foo*.vim macros/foo*.vim
is not valid while: >
    :SearchInRuntime! source /usr/local/share/vim/foo*.vim macros/foo*.vim
is accepted. 


When 'verbose' is one or higher, there is a message when no file could be found.
When 'verbose' is two or higher, there is a message about each file found.
When 'verbose' is three or higher, there is a message about each searched
directory.


Additional parameters~
When "| {params} .." is passed to :SearchIn*, then for each {file} found,
:SearchIn* will execute:
    :{cmd} {file} {params} ..

When "|0 {params} .." is passed to :SearchIn*, then for each {file} found,
:SearchIn* will execute:
    :{cmd} {params} .. {file}

                                                    *:SearchInVar*
:SearchInVar[!] {var} {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]~


Important:~
The variable {var} (containing the list of directories), that :SearchInVar is
expecting the name, must be visible outside the current scope. ie.: the variable
must be a |global-variable|, a |buffer-variable|, a |window-variable|, an
environment variable, or one of the vim |options| prepended by ampersand like
"&runtimepath". 
{var} can not be a |local-variable| nor a |script-variable|.

                                                    *:SearchInPATH*
:SearchInPATH[!] {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]~
is equivalent to:
    |:SearchInVar|[!] $PATH {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]

I.e.: the list of directories is taken from $PATH.

                                                    *:SearchInRuntime*
                                                    *search-in-runtimepath* 
:SearchInRuntime {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]~
is equivalent to:
    |:SearchInVar|[!] &runtimepath {cmd} {file-patterns}.. ["|[0]" {params}..]

I.e.: the list of directories is taken from 'runtimepath'.

Moreover,
    :SearchInRuntime[!] source {file-patterns} ..
is equivalent to:
    |:runtime|[!] {file-patterns} ..

                                                    *:Split* *:Vsplit*
:Split[!] {file-patterns} ...~
and
:Vsplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
look for files into 'path' and split open them like |:sp| or |:vsp| do.

When [!] is included, all found files are opened.
When it is not included only the first file found is opened.

They are somehow equivalent to: >
    :SearchInVar &path :sp {file-patterns}

NB:
- File-completion is provided, unlike |:sp| and |:vsp|. |SiR-completion|

See also |:GSplit| and |:GVSplit|

                                                    *:GSplit* *:GVSplit*
:GSplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
and
:GVSplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
look for files into 'path'.

If several files match the {file-patterns}, the user will be asked to choose
one file to open.

If a matching file is already opened in a window, this window is made the
active window. If several files match, we jump to the first matching window. 
Using {bang} (!) will override this bahavior. Instead, the user will be asked
which file must be opened if more than one match the {file-patterns}.

In either cases, if the selected (implictly or explicitly) file is not already
opened in a window, then a new window is split opened (like |:sp| or |:vsp| do)
with the selected file.

NB:
- These commands are related to |:Sp| and |:Vsp|.
- "G" stands for "Goto-or-".
- These commands require Vim 7+.
- File-completion is provided. |SiR-completion|
- When several files match, common path denominator are stripped from the
  choices proposed (e.g. "/some/path/bar/file" and "/some/path/foo/file" are
  presented as "bar/file" and "foo/file").

It is possible to use other command names if we define *g:sir_goto_hsplit* and
*g:sir_goto_vsplit* in the |.vimrc|. Their respective default values are
"GSplit" and "GVSplit". If "Split" or "Vsplit" are used, the default
bindings for |:Split|, or |:Vsplit|, are overridden by those of defaulted to
|:GSplit|, or |:GVSplit|.

                                                    *SiR-gf* *SiR-CTRL-W_f*
                                                    *SiR-CTRL-W_v*
Overrides of standard keybindings~
|gf|, |CTRL-W_f|, and |CTRL-W_v| are overridden in order:
- to ask the user which file must be opened if several files match, 
- and to jump to an already opened window containing the selected file.
- |CTRL-W_v| will do work as |CTRL-W_f|, but the window will be split
vertically. @todo support an option to not override default mecanism.
- Both mappings work in visual and in normal modes.

*glf* displays the list of files, in 'path', that match the filename under the
cursor.

:Runtime[!] {file-patterns}...~
is just a wrapper for |:runtime| but with auto-completion. See |SiR-completion|.

Examples and tips~

Note: this plugin also defines the command: >
    :command -nargs=+ Echo echo "<args>" 


And now are some of the different ways I use to use this plugin.
>
    :SearchInRuntime sp plugin/searchInRuntime.vim 
<       Will open in a split window the source of the file searchInRuntime.vim. 
        [the full path can be very long and not always the same] 
>
    :SearchInVar $INCLUDE sp vector
<       Will (if $INCLUDE is correctly set) open, in a |:split| window, the C++
        header file vector.
>
    :SearchInVar! $INCLUDE Echo *
<       Will echo the name of all the files present in the directories specified
        in $INCLUDE.
>
    :SearchInRuntime! Echo *.vim ftplugin/*_set.vim
<       Will echo the names of all the files, respecting the globing pattern,
        that can be found in the directories specified by 'runtimepath'.
>
    :SearchInRuntime! Echo *.vim ftplugin/*_set.vim | has been found!
<       Will echo the same files followed by the string "has been found!", on
        the same line. 
>
    :SearchInRuntime! grep plugin/*foo*.vim |0 text
<       For every {file} named plugin/*foo*.vim found within the 'runtimepath',
        this will execute: >
            :grep text {path-to-the-file}
>
    :command -nargs=+ ExeThis exe "!<args> ".bufname('%') 
    :SearchInRuntime! ExeThis tools/vimlatex
<       Will search where the executable vimlatex is, and execute it with
        bufname('%') as a parameter. 
>
    :exe ":SearchInRuntime 0r template/template.".&ft 
<       Will load the content of the file template/template.{filetype} that
        should be somewhere in the 'runtimepath'. 
>
    :command! -nargs=+ MemorizeSiRFiles exe 
        \ ':let s:SiR_files=s:SiR_files."\n<args>"'
    :SearchInRuntime! MemorizeSiRFiles 
        \ plugin/searchInRuntime.vim
        \ doc/searchInRuntime.txt
<       Will build s:SiR_files with the exact paths of the two files
        searchInRuntime.vim and searchInRuntime.txt.
        Then, in tar-scripts.vim (on my web site), I use this variable to check
        if any of the two files has been updated since last check up.
>
    :e /tmp/searchInRuntime-feedback.vim
    :SearchInRuntime diffsplit plugin/searchInRuntime.vim
<       Will compare a working copy of a file with the one in the
        'runtimepath'.

                                                *SiR-completion*
A few word about automatic completion~

Since the version 2.0.1 of searchInRuntime, all these commands support
|cmdline-completion|. This means we can hit |c_CTRL-D|, |c_<Tab>|, |C_CTRL-A|,
|c_CTRL-L|, ..., to expand the pattern in front of the cursor according to the
type of the parameters expected by the current command (see all three syntaxes).

Note however this feature requires Vim compiled with the |+cmdline_compl|
feature not disabled.
