DESCRIPTION					*CaptureClipboard-description*

Quotes or text fragments can be collected from various sources outside Vim
into a single text document through the clipboard. This plugin makes
consecutive copy-and-pastes into Vim much more comfortable by monitoring the
system clipboard for changes and appending them into the current Vim buffer
automatically. Feedback about the number of captures is given in Vim's window
title, so one does not have to switch back and forth between applications any
more, and can completely focus on text collection via CTRL-C, CTRL-C, ...

==============================================================================
USAGE						      *CaptureClipboard-usage*
				*:CaptureClipboard* *:CaptureClipboardReverse*
:[count]CaptureClipboard[!] [{delimiter}]
:[count]CaptureClipboardReverse[!] [{delimiter}]
			Monitors the clipboard for changes and inserts any
			change of clipboard contents into the current buffer
			(in new lines, or delimited by {delimiter} if given).
			To stop, press <CTRL-C> or copy a literal dot (".") to
			the clipboard. If [count] is given, the capture stops
			after [count] captures.

			If [!] is given, whitespace (including new lines) is
			trimmed from the beginning and end of each capture.

			With :CaptureClipboardReverse, changes are prepended,
			reverting the insertion order. Normally, changes are
			appended to the current or given [line].
			Use :$|CaptureClipboard to append to the end of the
			current buffer.

			{delimiter} is evaluated as an expression if it is
			(single- or double-)quoted, or contains backslashes.
			The default {delimiter} is "\n"; each capture is
			placed on a new line. Use '' to place everything next
			to each other, ' ' to put a space character in
			between, "\n--\n" to insert a -- separator line
			between captures. When {delimiter} contains a newline
			character, the first capture will already start on a
			new line.

								  *i_CTRL-R_?*
CTRL-R ?		Wait for one capture from the clipboard and insert it
			at the current cursor position.

INSTALLATION				       *CaptureClipboard-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim CaptureClipboard*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				       *CaptureClipboard-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				      *CaptureClipboard-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					 *g:CaptureClipboard_DefaultDelimiter*
By default, each capture will be placed on a new line in the capture buffer;
i.e. the delimiter between captures is a newline character: >
    let g:CaptureClipboard_DefaultDelimiter = "\n"
<
				       *g:CaptureClipboard_EndOfCaptureMarker*
The marker text that will stop capturing can be changed via: >
    let g:CaptureClipboard_EndOfCaptureMarker = '.'
<
					       *g:CaptureClipboard_IsAutoSave*
If you capture a lot of text or the captured information is very valuable, you
can automatically persist the capture buffer after each capture. Enable via: >
    let g:CaptureClipboard_IsAutoSave = 1
<
						 *g:CaptureClipboard_Register*
In X, changes to the current selection (|quotestar|) are captured. If you want
to only capture changes to the X clipboard (|quoteplus|), not every change in
selection, use: >
    let g:CaptureClipboard_Register = '+'
<
						      *CaptureClipboard-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(CaptureClipboardInsertOne) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-R>? <Plug>(CaptureClipboardInsertOne)
<
